# Working with the Vault

You can use `brew install vault` to install the command line interface and interact with the Hashicorp vault.

In order to do this, you will need to store two env variables:

```bash
# replace this with the token from the previous step
export VAULT_TOKEN=<your vault token>
# replace the IP with what Metallb allocated (in a production environment this should be fixed with the "loadBalancerIP:" value in the helm values)
export VAULT_ADDR='http://10.0.2.200:8200'
```

At this point `vault status` should display the status of the vault

```bash
fabrice in üåê central-1 in mikrok8s on ÓÇ† main [!?] took 2s
‚ùØ export VAULT_TOKEN=hvs.7Ol.... # your vault token

fabrice in üåê central-1 in mikrok8s on ÓÇ† main [!?]
‚ùØ export VAULT_ADDR='http://10.0.2.200:8200'

fabrice in üåê central-1 in mikrok8s on ÓÇ† main [!?]
‚ùØ vault status

```

After this you could list the secret (engines) with

```bash
vault secrets list
